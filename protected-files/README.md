# Protected Files

This directory contains author-protected backup files that are preserved across user modifications.

## Purpose
These files serve as a fallback mechanism to restore critical module functionality if needed. They are:
- Not visible to end users
- Not accessible to the AI assistant during normal operations
- Maintained by module authors only

## Note for Administrators
Do not modify files in this directory unless you are the original module author or have explicit authorization.
