# Workspace Structure Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions for organizing AI specialist workspaces to enable effective persistent memory and knowledge management.

## Standard Architecture Overview

Every AI specialist should follow this consistent workspace structure:

```
specialist-name/
├── ai-instructions/           # Core programming
├── memory/                   # User-specific information
├── knowledge/                # Domain expertise
├── active-projects/          # Current focus areas
├── historical/               # Archived context
└── resources/                # Supporting materials (optional)
```

This structure provides:
- **Clear separation** between different types of information
- **Scalable organization** that works for simple and complex specialists
- **Human-readable format** for transparency and control
- **Logical hierarchy** that mirrors human thinking patterns

## Detailed Directory Structure

### `/ai-instructions/` - Core Programming
The specialist's fundamental operating instructions.

```
ai-instructions/
├── core-instructions.md      # Primary programming and behavior
├── memory-protocols.md       # How to handle memory updates
├── interaction-styles.md     # Communication preferences and patterns
└── quality-standards.md      # Response quality guidelines (optional)
```

**Purpose**: Define how the specialist operates, communicates, and learns.
**Permanence**: Stable unless explicitly updated.
**Access**: Read frequently by specialist, modified rarely by user.

### `/memory/` - User-Specific Information
Everything the specialist learns about the individual user.

```
memory/
├── user-profile.md           # Core user characteristics

```

**Purpose**: Store supporting materials that enhance specialist effectiveness.
**Permanence**: Relatively stable, updated as new resources are discovered.
**Access**: Periodic reference for recommendations and guidance.

## File Content Guidelines

### Naming Conventions
- Use **kebab-case** for file names: `user-profile.md`, `weekly-focus.md`
- Include dates for time-sensitive content: `project-archive-2024-03.md`
- Be descriptive but concise: `communication-preferences.md` not `prefs.md`

### Content Organization
Each file should have:
```markdown
# File Title

## Summary
Brief overview of file contents and purpose

## [Section 1]
Organized content using clear headers

## [Section 2]

### Workspace Migration
When moving between platforms:
1. **Export all files** in standard markdown format
2. **Verify structure integrity** in new environment
3. **Test memory retrieval** and update mechanisms
4. **Validate specialist behavior** with known test cases

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Memory Retrieval Problems
- **Check file organization** for logical structure
- **Verify content formatting** for consistent headers
- **Review information distribution** across appropriate files
- **Test search/retrieval** mechanisms

### Information Overload
- **Consolidate similar entries** to reduce redundancy
- **Archive historical information** that's no longer immediately relevant
- **Improve organization** with better categorization
- **Implement filtering** for context-appropriate information

### Inconsistent Information
- **Regular consistency audits** across related files
- **Clear update protocols** for conflicting information
- **User clarification processes** for ambiguous data
- **Version tracking** for information evolution

Remember: The workspace structure is a tool to enable effective persistent memory. Adapt it thoughtfully based on your specific domain and user needs while maintaining the core architectural principles.
