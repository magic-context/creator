# AI Specialist Technical Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for creating AI specialists from scratch using GitHub. After completing the [Product Planning Guide](product-planning-guide.md), follow these steps to build your specialist.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- GitHub account
- Git installed on your computer
- Text editor (VS Code, Sublime, or similar)
- Your completed Product Planning Guide

## Step 1: Create Repository Structure

### Initialize Your Repository

```bash
# Create a new directory for your specialist
mkdir my-specialist-name
cd my-specialist-name

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Create the required directory structure
mkdir -p configuration
mkdir -p content/ai-instructions
mkdir -p protected-files

# Create placeholder file for protected-files (optional)
echo "# Protected Files\nPrivate configuration files go here" > protected-files/README.md
```

### Understanding the Structure

```
your-specialist/
â”œâ”€â”€ configuration/          # Specialist metadata and settings
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ module.json        # REQUIRED: Defines your specialist
â”œâ”€â”€ content/               # All specialist content
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md         # REQUIRED: User-facing documentation (auto-loaded)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ai-instructions/   # REQUIRED: AI behavior programming
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ getting_started.md  # REQUIRED: AI initialization (auto-loaded)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ core-instructions.md # REQUIRED: Detailed AI programming
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [your-domains]/   # Your custom content folders
â””â”€â”€ protected-files/      # Optional: Private configurations
```

## Step 2: Configure Your Specialist

### Create `/configuration/module.json`

This file defines your specialist's identity and structure:

```json
{
  "module": {
    "id": "your-specialist-id",
    "name": "Your Specialist Name",
    "role": "Primary role and expertise description",
    "default-display-name": "Default Name for Users",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "Brief description of what your specialist does",
    "created": "2025-09-27",
    "updated": "2025-09-27"
  },
  "structure": {
    "ai-instructions": "Core AI behavior and guidance",
    "your-domain-folder": "Description of what this folder contains",
    "another-folder": "Description of another folder"
  },
  "features": [
    "Key feature or capability 1",
    "Key feature or capability 2",
    "Key feature or capability 3",
    "Key feature or capability 4"
  ]
}
```

### Configuration Guidelines

**Module Section:**
- `id`: Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces)
- `name`: Short name for the specialist type
- `role`: Clear description of the specialist's primary role and expertise
- `default-display-name`: Default name shown to users (can be customized on import)
- `description`: One-line summary of specialist's purpose
- `version`: Semantic versioning (start with 1.0.0)

**Structure Section:**
- Map each content folder to its purpose
- Help users understand your organization
- Keep descriptions concise but clear

**Features Section:**
- List 3-5 core capabilities
- Focus on unique value propositions
- Use action-oriented language

### Real Example

Here's a complete example for a Development Manager specialist:

```json
{
  "module": {
    "id": "dev-manager",
    "name": "Development Manager",
    "role": "Sprint management and team coordination assistant",
    "default-display-name": "Dev Manager",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "Helps development teams track sprints, manage technical debt, and run effective standups",
    "created": "2025-09-27",
    "updated": "2025-09-27"
  },
  "structure": {
    "ai-instructions": "Sprint facilitation and team management behavior",
    "sprints": "Current and historical sprint tracking",
    "team": "Team member profiles and working patterns",
    "technical-debt": "Debt tracking and prioritization",
    "retrospectives": "Team learnings and process improvements"
  },
  "features": [
    "Context-aware standup facilitation",
    "Sprint progress and velocity tracking",
    "Technical debt identification and management",
    "Team pattern recognition and insights",
    "Blocker detection and resolution tracking"
  ]
}
```

## Step 5: Create Domain Structure

Based on your Product Planning Guide, create your domain-specific folders:

```bash
# Example for a fitness coach specialist
mkdir -p content/workouts
mkdir -p content/nutrition
mkdir -p content/progress
mkdir -p content/preferences

# Create README files to explain each folder's purpose
echo "# Workouts\nPersonalized exercise routines and training plans" > content/workouts/README.md
echo "# Nutrition\nMeal planning, dietary goals, and nutritional guidance" > content/nutrition/README.md
echo "# Progress\nFitness metrics, achievements, and progress tracking" > content/progress/README.md
echo "# Preferences\nUser's fitness style, constraints, and preferences" > content/preferences/README.md
```

### Domain Folder Best Practices

**Naming Conventions:**
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Lowercase with hyphens (kebab-case)
- Avoid abbreviations unless obvious

**Organization Principles:**
- Separate user data from reference material
- Keep related information together
- Use subfolders for complex domains
- Include README files to explain purpose

**Example Domain Structures:**

```
# Project Management Specialist
content/
â”œâ”€â”€ projects/          # Active project tracking
â”œâ”€â”€ team/             # Team member profiles
â”œâ”€â”€ sprints/          # Sprint planning and tracking
â”œâ”€â”€ retrospectives/   # Lessons and improvements
â””â”€â”€ templates/        # Reusable project templates

# Learning Tutor Specialist
content/
â”œâ”€â”€ subjects/         # Subject-specific content
â”œâ”€â”€ study-plans/      # Personalized learning paths
â”œâ”€â”€ progress/         # Learning metrics and achievements
â”œâ”€â”€ resources/        # Educational materials
â””â”€â”€ techniques/       # Study methods and strategies
```

## Step 6: Add Templates and Resources

Create helpful templates for your specialist's domain:

```bash
# Create templates directory
mkdir -p content/templates

# Add domain-specific templates
# Example for a project management specialist:
cat > content/templates/project-template.md << 'EOF'
# Project: [Name]

---

## Quick Start Alternative

**Note**: If you want to quickly prototype or have a very similar use case to an existing specialist, you can:

1. Find an existing specialist on GitHub
2. Fork or download their repository
3. Replace the content while maintaining the structure
4. Update configuration and documentation
5. Test and deploy

This approach is faster but less customized. The full creation process above gives you complete control and understanding of your specialist.
