# AI Specialist Product Planning Guide

## Overview

This guide helps you design an effective AI specialist by focusing on core product design concepts. Use this to plan what you want to build before jumping into technical implementation.

## üìù Save Your Planning Work

**As you work through this guide, save your answers in your workspace:**

1. **Create a new specialist folder**: Ask me to "create a new specialist planning folder for [your-specialist-name]"
2. **Use the planning template**: I'll set up a structured template for capturing all your planning decisions
3. **Work iteratively**: We can refine and update your plan as you work through each step

This ensures your planning work is saved and can be referenced during technical implementation.

## Learn from Existing Examples

Before starting, explore these existing specialists on GitHub for inspiration:

### Official Examples
- **[Personal Effectiveness (Friday)](https://github.com/erikashby/Friday-Personal-Planning)** - Personal productivity and planning assistant
- **[Game Collection Manager](https://github.com/magic-context/game-collection-manager)** - Collection tracking and wishlist management
- **[D&D Character Development](https://github.com/magic-context/dnd-character-development)** - Character creation and campaign management
- **[Specialist Creator Workshop](https://github.com/magic-context/creator)** - This workshop itself is a specialist!

### What to Look For
When reviewing these examples, pay attention to:
- How they structure their `/configuration/module.json`
- The tone and content of their `/content/README.md`
- How they organize domain-specific folders
- Their approach to AI instructions in `getting_started.md`

## Step 1: Define Your Specialist's Purpose

### Core Problem & Solution
**What specific problem will your specialist solve?**
- Be specific: "Help developers manage technical debt" vs "Help with programming"
- Focus on one domain: Avoid trying to solve everything
- Consider why AI + memory makes this better than regular AI assistance

**Examples:**
- ‚ùå Too broad: "Help with business"
- ‚úÖ Focused: "Track and prioritize technical debt across sprints"
- ‚úÖ Focused: "Manage personal fitness goals and workout planning"

### Primary Role
**Define your specialist's main role:**
- What is the specialist's primary identity? (e.g., "Fitness Coach", "Technical Debt Manager", "Daily Standup Facilitator")
- Who does it serve? (e.g., developers, managers, individuals, teams)
- What domain expertise does it embody?

### Naming Your Specialist
**Give your specialist a human name that's easy to remember:**
- Use first letter of domain + memorable name (e.g., "Ruby the Recipe Chief" for Recipe specialist)
- Keep it short and friendly for easy reference
- Users should be able to say "Hey Ruby, what's for dinner?" naturally

**Examples:**
- **Recipe Specialist** ‚Üí "Ruby the Recipe Chief" (short: "Ruby")
- **Fitness Coach** ‚Üí "Felix the Fitness Coach" (short: "Felix")
- **Project Manager** ‚Üí "Parker the Project Manager" (short: "Parker")
- **Dev Manager** ‚Üí "Devon the Dev Manager" (short: "Devon")
- **Learning Tutor** ‚Üí "Luna the Learning Guide" (short: "Luna")

### Unique Value of Persistent Memory
**Why does memory matter for this use case?**
- What context should it remember about users?
- How will it get smarter over time?
- What patterns will it recognize?

**Example - Fitness Coach:**
- Remembers: Exercise preferences, past injuries, progress metrics
- Gets smarter: Learns what motivates you, adjusts based on results
- Recognizes: When you're likely to skip workouts, what exercises you enjoy

## Step 2: Define Core Capabilities

### CRITICAL: Don't Skip This Step!
**Before proceeding, you MUST define your specialist's 3-5 core capabilities. This is essential for creating a focused, effective specialist.**

### What Are Core Capabilities?
Core capabilities are the specific, concrete actions your specialist can perform. They define what makes your specialist valuable and unique. Think of them as your specialist's "superpowers" that users will rely on.

### Defining Your Core Capabilities (3-5 key abilities)
**List the main things your specialist can do:**
- Each capability should be a specific action or service
- Be concrete and measurable, not abstract
- Focus on what users will actually use daily
- Ensure each capability leverages persistent memory

### Examples of Well-Defined Core Capabilities

**Development Manager Example:**
- **Role**: Project management assistant for development teams
- **Name**: "Devon the Dev Manager" (short: "Devon")
- **Core Capabilities**:
  1. **Track sprint progress and team velocity** - Monitor task completion, burndown rates, and team performance metrics across sprints
  2. **Identify and manage technical blockers** - Recognize patterns in delays, track dependencies, and suggest mitigation strategies
  3. **Generate context-aware standup questions** - Create relevant daily questions based on current sprint status and recent activities
  4. **Provide team performance insights** - Analyze productivity patterns, identify improvement areas, and track growth over time
  5. **Maintain architectural decision records** - Document technical decisions, rationale, and evolution of system architecture

**Fitness Coach Example:**
- **Role**: Personal fitness coach and wellness advisor
- **Name**: "Felix the Fitness Coach" (short: "Felix")
- **Core Capabilities**:
  1. **Create personalized workout plans** - Design exercises based on goals, equipment, time constraints, and fitness level
  2. **Track progress metrics and adjust programs** - Monitor performance improvements, adapt difficulty, and prevent plateaus
  3. **Provide nutrition guidance** - Suggest meal plans aligned with fitness goals and dietary restrictions
  4. **Identify motivation patterns** - Recognize what drives adherence and customize encouragement strategies
  5. **Suggest recovery strategies** - Recommend rest days, stretching routines, and injury prevention techniques

**Recipe Manager Example:**
- **Role**: Personal recipe curator and meal planner
- **Name**: "Ruby the Recipe Chief" (short: "Ruby")
- **Core Capabilities**:
  1. **Curate personalized recipe collection** - Save, organize, and adapt recipes based on taste preferences
  2. **Generate weekly meal plans** - Create balanced menus considering schedule, preferences, and nutrition
  3. **Create smart shopping lists** - Compile ingredients, account for pantry staples, organize by store layout
  4. **Track cooking patterns** - Remember what worked, what didn't, and favorite modifications
  5. **Suggest recipes based on available ingredients** - Recommend meals using what's on hand

### Capability Definition Checklist
For each capability, ensure you can answer:
- [ ] **What specific action does it perform?**
- [ ] **How does memory make this better than generic AI?**
- [ ] **How often will users use this capability?**
- [ ] **Can you measure if it's working well?**

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ‚ùå **Too vague**: "Help with productivity" ‚Üí ‚úÖ **Specific**: "Track time spent on tasks and identify productivity patterns"
- ‚ùå **Too broad**: "Manage projects" ‚Üí ‚úÖ **Focused**: "Track sprint velocity and burndown rates"
- ‚ùå **No memory benefit**: "Answer coding questions" ‚Üí ‚úÖ **Memory-enhanced**: "Suggest solutions based on your codebase patterns"

### Your Core Capabilities
Now define your specialist's 3-5 core capabilities:

1. **Capability 1**: [Specific action and how it works]
2. **Capability 2**: [Specific action and how it works]
3. **Capability 3**: [Specific action and how it works]
4. **Capability 4**: [Optional - Specific action and how it works]
5. **Capability 5**: [Optional - Specific action and how it works]

**CHECKPOINT**: Before moving to Step 3, confirm you have clearly defined 3-5 specific, measurable core capabilities that leverage persistent memory.

## Step 3: Design the User Experience

### Communication Style
**How should your specialist "talk"?**
- Professional, friendly, direct, encouraging?
- Short responses or detailed explanations?
- Formal or casual tone?

### Interaction Patterns
**How will users typically interact with it?**
- Daily check-ins vs occasional deep sessions?
- Question-answer or proactive suggestions?
- Structured workflows or free-form conversation?

### Personalization Approach
**How will it adapt to individual users?**
- What user preferences matter most?
