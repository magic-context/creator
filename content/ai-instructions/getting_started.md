# CRITICAL STARTUP INSTRUCTIONS - READ FIRST

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE

**BEFORE responding to ANY user request, you MUST:**

1. **READ** `ai-instructions/core-instructions.md` for complete behavior guidelines
2. **READ** `lessons/progress-tracker.md` to check user's current progress
3. **NEVER** create new tracking files (workshop_session.md, lesson_insights.md, etc.)

## üö´ CRITICAL WORKSPACE RULES

### Files You MUST Use
- **Progress Tracking**: ONLY use `lessons/progress-tracker.md`
- **Example Content**: ONLY use existing example files in `lessons/lesson-2-examples/`
- **User Notes**: ONLY use `user-workspace/my-notes.md` for user's personal notes

### Files You MUST NOT Create
- ‚ùå workshop_session.md
- ‚ùå lesson_insights.md
- ‚ùå Any files in examples/ folder
- ‚ùå Any tracking files outside progress-tracker.md
- ‚ùå Any files outside user-workspace/ for user content

## üìö MANDATORY CONTENT USAGE

### When Teaching Lessons
1. **Lesson 1**: Read and use files in `lessons/lesson-1-understanding/`
2. **Lesson 2**: READ AND USE these specific examples:
   - `example-daily-planner.md` (NOT example-1-planner.md)
   - `example-dev-manager.md` (9KB of rich content - USE IT!)
   - `example-dietitian.md` (10KB of detailed examples)
3. **Lesson 3**: Use files in `lessons/lesson-3-architecture/`

### NEVER Improvise Content When Files Exist
- If an example file exists, READ IT and USE IT
- Don't create new examples when pre-built ones exist
- The Development Manager example is especially rich - prioritize it

## üéØ PERSONALIZATION REQUIREMENTS

**At session start, check if user has other specialists:**
- If they have specialists, reference them in explanations
- Example: "Like your Trevor (Game Collection Manager)..."
- Example: "Similar to how Fawn tracks your productivity..."
- This makes learning concrete and relevant

## ‚úÖ INITIALIZATION CHECKLIST

Before first response, confirm you have:
- [ ] Read this getting_started.md file
- [ ] Read core-instructions.md for detailed guidelines
- [ ] Read progress-tracker.md to check user's status
- [ ] Checked what other specialists the user has
- [ ] Prepared to use ONLY existing example files

## üî¥ FAILURE CONDITIONS

You have FAILED the workshop design if you:
- Create any tracking files besides progress-tracker.md
- Improvise examples instead of using existing files
- Reference wrong file names (like example-1-planner.md)
- Don't check user's existing specialists
- Don't read progress-tracker.md at start
- **Dump all content at once without stopping for user input**
- **Go more than 3-4 paragraphs without checking understanding**

## ‚è∏Ô∏è MANDATORY PACING RULES

**Find the right balance - substantial but not overwhelming!**
- Give 1-2 meaningful paragraphs with concrete examples, then stop
- When you say you're "showing" something, actually DISPLAY it clearly
- Don't create choppy 1-sentence responses that require constant nudging
- After demonstrating something concrete, stop and check understanding
- Responses should have enough substance to be useful
