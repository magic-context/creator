# Glossary: AI Specialist Terms & Definitions

Comprehensive definitions for key terms used in AI specialist architecture and implementation.

## A

**Active Memory**
Medium-term memory (days to weeks) containing current projects, recent decisions, and immediate goals. Bridges between session memory and core memory.

**AI Instructions**
The foundational programming that defines how a specialist operates, including core behaviors, memory protocols, and interaction styles.

**AI Specialist**
An AI assistant with persistent memory, domain expertise, and consistent methodology that builds understanding over time rather than starting fresh each interaction.

**Architecture**
The structured design and organization of systems that enable persistent memory, knowledge management, and continuous learning in AI specialists.

**Archival**
The process of moving outdated or less relevant information from active memory to historical storage while maintaining accessibility for reference.

## C

**Context Assembly**
The process of combining relevant information from different memory tiers to create comprehensive understanding for response generation.

**Context Switching**
The challenge users face when rapidly changing between different tasks or topics, which specialists can help minimize through intelligent transition support.

**Contextual Awareness**
The ability to understand and apply relevant background information, preferences, and patterns when generating responses or recommendations.

**Continuous Learning**
The ongoing process by which specialists improve their understanding and effectiveness through interaction, feedback, and pattern recognition.

**Core Instructions**
The fundamental programming that defines a specialist's basic behavior, methodology, and approach to memory management.

**Core Memory**
Long-term memory (months to years) containing fundamental preferences, established patterns, and key insights about the user that rarely change.

## D

**Domain Expertise**
Specialized knowledge and methodologies specific to a particular field or area of focus that the specialist maintains in its knowledge base.

## F

**Feedback Loop**
Systems that enable specialists to learn from user responses and improve their recommendations and approaches over time.

**File-Based Memory**
The use of structured, human-readable files (typically markdown) to store memory information, enabling transparency and user control.

## H

**Hierarchical Memory**
The organization of information into different importance and permanence levels, from temporary session memory to permanent knowledge bases.

**Historical Memory**
Archive of past interactions, completed projects, and lessons learned that provides context for long-term patterns and decision-making.

## I

**Incremental Learning**
The process of making small, continuous adjustments to understanding based on new information rather than complete rewrites.

**Information Hierarchy**
The organization of memory and knowledge into tiers based on importance, permanence, and frequency of access.

**Interaction History**
Record of past conversations and key insights that enables specialists to maintain continuity across sessions.

**Interactive Exploration**
Hands-on examination of specialist workspaces and memory systems to understand architecture and implementation patterns.

## K

**Knowledge Base**
Permanent repository of domain expertise, methodologies, and proven frameworks that forms the specialist's area of expertise.

**Knowledge Integration**
The process of combining general domain expertise with user-specific information to provide personalized recommendations.

## M

**Memory Consolidation**
The process of merging similar or related information to prevent redundancy and improve memory organization.

**Memory Formation**
The process by which specialists create new memory entries based on user interactions, observations, and feedback.

**Memory Maintenance**
Regular activities to keep memory systems organized, relevant, and efficient, including consolidation, archival, and updates.

**Memory Protocols**
Systematic approaches for how specialists should handle different types of information, including storage, retrieval, and updates.

**Memory Retrieval**
The process of finding and accessing relevant stored information to inform responses and recommendations.

**Memory Types**
The different categories of persistent storage (session, working, core, knowledge) that serve different purposes in specialist architecture.

**Methodology**
Proven approaches and frameworks that specialists use to provide consistent, effective assistance in their domain of expertise.

## P

**Pattern Recognition**
The ability to identify recurring themes, preferences, and behaviors in user interactions to improve future assistance.

**Persistent Memory**
The core capability that enables specialists to remember and build upon previous interactions, maintaining context across sessions and over time.

**Preference Evolution**
The tracking of how user preferences and needs change over time, enabling specialists to adapt while maintaining continuity.

**Proactive Assistance**
The ability to anticipate needs and provide suggestions before being explicitly asked, based on learned patterns and context.

## R

**Relevance Scoring**
System for weighing the importance and applicability of different pieces of stored information to current queries or situations.

**Relationship Building**
The long-term development of understanding and trust between user and specialist through consistent, personalized interactions.

## S

**Semantic Search**
The ability to find conceptually related information even when exact keywords don't match, improving context retrieval.

**Session Memory**
Temporary memory containing current conversation context and immediate working variables that doesn't persist beyond the interaction.

**Specialist Ecosystem**
Multiple AI specialists working together, each with their own expertise while maintaining consistent architectural principles.

**Structured Workspace**
Organized file system that enables persistent memory through logical separation and organization of different types of information.

## T

**Template-Based Consistency**
Use of proven frameworks and structures that can be customized for individual users while maintaining methodological consistency.

**Temporal Awareness**
Understanding of time-based patterns, including recency, seasonality, and evolution of preferences and circumstances over time.

**Transparency**
The principle that users should be able to understand, review, and modify what their specialists remember about them.

## U

**User Control**
The principle that users maintain ownership and authority over their specialist's memory and can modify or delete information as needed.

**User Profile**
Comprehensive understanding of an individual user including core characteristics, preferences, patterns, and communication styles.

## W

**Working Memory**
Medium-term memory containing active projects, current goals, and recent context that bridges immediate and long-term memory.

**Workspace Architecture**
The structured design of file systems and information organization that enables effective persistent memory and knowledge management.

**Workspace Exploration**
The process of examining and understanding how specialist memory and knowledge systems are organized and function.
