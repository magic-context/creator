# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about AI specialist architecture, implementation, and usage.

## Getting Started

### Q: What's the difference between an AI specialist and ChatGPT/Claude?
**A:** The key difference is **persistent memory**. Regular AI conversations start fresh each time, while specialists remember your preferences, context, and patterns across sessions. Specialists also have focused domain expertise and consistent methodologies, making them more like having a dedicated consultant who knows your history.

### Q: Do I need technical skills to create AI specialists?
**A:** Basic file organization skills are helpful, but you don't need programming expertise. Specialists use human-readable markdown files for memory storage, and the templates provided guide you through the setup process. The most important skills are understanding your domain and being able to organize information logically.

### Q: How long does it take to set up a specialist?
**A:** Initial setup takes 30-60 minutes using the provided templates. However, specialists become truly effective after 2-4 weeks of regular interaction as they learn your patterns and preferences. The real value compounds over months and years of use.

## Architecture & Memory

### Q: How much memory can a specialist maintain?
**A:** There's no hard limit, but practical considerations include response time and relevance. Most effective specialists maintain:
- **Core memory**: 5-10 key preference categories
- **Working memory**: 3-5 active projects or goals
- **Knowledge base**: Domain-specific expertise (varies widely)
- **Historical archive**: Important past context (organized by relevance)

### Q: What if I want to change or delete something the specialist remembers?
**A:** All specialist memory is stored in human-readable files that you can directly edit or delete. You have complete control over what your specialist remembers. You can also ask the specialist to "forget" specific information or update outdated preferences.

### Q: How does the specialist know what's important to remember?
**A:** Specialists use several signals:
- **Explicit feedback**: "This is important" or "Remember this approach"
- **Pattern recognition**: Things you mention repeatedly become important
- **Outcome tracking**: Approaches that work well get reinforced
- **Recency**: Recent information is weighted more heavily
- **User behavior**: What you act on vs. what you ignore

### Q: Can specialists share memory with each other?
**A:** By default, no. Each specialist maintains its own workspace. However, you can explicitly share specific information between specialists if needed. This separation prevents confusion and maintains focused expertise areas.

## Implementation & Technical

### Q: Where is the specialist memory stored?
**A:** Memory is typically stored locally in structured markdown files, though this depends on your implementation. The key principle is that you maintain control over your data. Cloud-based implementations should still give you access to and control over your memory files.

### Q: What happens if I lose my specialist's memory?
**A:** If you have backups of the workspace files, you can restore full memory. Without backups, you'd need to rebuild the relationship, but this typically happens faster the second time since you know your preferences. This is why regular backups of specialist workspaces are recommended.

### Q: Can I use the same specialist on different devices?
**A:** Yes, if you sync the workspace files across devices. Many users store specialist workspaces in cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) to maintain access from multiple locations while retaining control over their data.

### Q: How do specialists handle conflicting information?
**A:** Specialists use several strategies:
- **Recency bias**: Newer information typically overrides older information
- **Explicit correction**: Direct statements like "Actually, I prefer..." take priority
- **Context consideration**: Different preferences for different contexts (work vs. personal)
- **User clarification**: When in doubt, the specialist asks for clarification

## Performance & Optimization

### Q: My specialist seems to have "forgotten" something important. Why?
**A:** Several possibilities:
- Information was stored in session/working memory instead of core memory
- The information wasn't tagged or organized for easy retrieval
- Context retrieval isn't finding relevant information efficiently
- The specialist needs explicit instruction about what's important

Check the memory files directly to see where information is stored and how it's organized.

### Q: How can I make my specialist more effective?
**A:** Best practices include:
- **Provide regular feedback** on what works and what doesn't
- **Be explicit about preferences** rather than expecting the specialist to guess
- **Review and organize memory** periodically to ensure important information is accessible
- **Use the specialist consistently** so it can learn your patterns
- **Update outdated information** to maintain relevance

### Q: My specialist gives responses that are too long/short. How do I fix this?
**A:** Update the communication preferences in the user profile:
- Add specific guidance about preferred response length
- Provide examples of ideal responses
- Use feedback like "That was too detailed" or "I need more context"
- Update the AI instructions with specific length guidelines

## Privacy & Security

### Q: Is my data private when using specialists?
**A:** This depends on your implementation. The architecture is designed for privacy:
- Memory is stored in files you control
- No inherent sharing between specialists
- You can review and modify all stored information

However, check the specific platform or implementation you're using for their privacy policies.

### Q: Can I audit what my specialist knows about me?
**A:** Yes! This is a key feature of the architecture. All memory is stored in human-readable markdown files organized by type (profile, preferences, history, etc.). You can read these files directly to see exactly what the specialist remembers.

### Q: What if I want to start fresh with a specialist?
**A:** You can:
- **Full reset**: Delete all memory files and start over
- **Partial reset**: Keep domain knowledge but clear personal memory
- **Archive and restart**: Move current memory to archive and start fresh
- **Selective editing**: Remove specific memories while keeping others

## Use Cases & Applications

### Q: What types of specialists work best?
**A:** Most effective specialists have:
- **Clear domain focus**: Specific area of expertise
- **Repeating interactions**: Regular ongoing relationship
- **Complex context**: Situations where memory provides value
- **Personal variation**: Where individual preferences matter

Examples: Project management, health coaching, learning tutoring, creative writing, daily planning.

### Q: Can I have multiple specialists for different areas?
**A:** Yes! Many users maintain specialist teams:
- **Professional**: Project manager, technical writer, research assistant
- **Personal**: Health coach, daily planner, learning tutor
- **Creative**: Writing coach, design assistant, content strategist

Each maintains separate memory and expertise while following consistent architectural principles.

### Q: How do I know if a specialist is worth creating?
**A:** Consider creating a specialist if:
- You have recurring needs in a specific domain
- Context and memory would improve the assistance
- You want consistency in approach and methodology
- The area is complex enough to benefit from persistent relationship
- You're willing to invest in the initial setup and ongoing interaction

## Troubleshooting

**A:** Check:
- Is feedback being stored in memory files?
- Are memory protocols correctly implemented?
- Is the specialist retrieving updated information when responding?
- Are you providing specific enough feedback for the specialist to understand and apply?

### Q: The specialist seems inconsistent in its responses.
**A:** Possible causes:
- Core preferences aren't clearly established or are conflicting
- Memory retrieval isn't consistently finding relevant context
